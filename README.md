This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Sean:

I swapped to App Router
There is some cool patterns it has access to that pages router does not and I wanted to practice
There are some rough edges not present in remix but it still works
I highly recommend you watch this video:

I am honestly not sure how to test this style of app since it runs on the server

I went very very light on undefined/null-checking

Error handling is kind of proprietary in the next space so I was going to ask you how you'd want those handled
Showing Error Boundaries and things like that are my preferred way

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
